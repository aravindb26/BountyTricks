[HTTP Request Smuggling](https://github.com/defparam/smuggler)

- [x] Github local recon - usage: gitsecrets ‚Äúword‚Äù | gf pattern

```
gitsecrets(){
{ find .git/objects/pack/ -name "*.idx"|while read i;do git show-index < "$i"|awk '{print $2}';done;find .git/objects/ -type f|grep -v '/pack/'|awk -F'/' '{print $(NF-1)$NF}'; }|while read o;do git cat-file -p $o;done|grep -E "$1"

### :guardsman: Private Nuclei templates

- [x] SSRF nuclei template - Feed endpoints to probe for SSRF interaction automatically, the module tries to fetch simple interaction on the provided input, and later appends common SSRF query params to the original request.

Sample:

```
echo "https://checkout.stripe.com/api/color?image_url=" | nuclei -t ssrf.yaml 
```
